                      One of the most interesing things about human kind is it's intelligence, is it possible to create something similar? and something better? That is how my interest in artificial intelligence started and why I decided to course a master in AI.

                    No lecturer or student likes it when they hold a presentation and they need to run back and forth in the room just to press that keyboard button only to change a slide. And, surely, noone likes it when they forget their presentation pointer at home or their pointer runs out of battery while defending their thesis.

                    The purpose of this research project is developing a system that can track the presenter and read his posture and gestures to make changes in the presentation. The main constraint is that the information can only be collected through the webcam of the laptop of the presenter. This also creates a power constrain.

                    After working on the research project "Predicting FOREX Market trends: Making money out of money" I decided to start the project from scratch. The approach used this time is very different but uses all the knowledge gained. It is also a longer project that requires much more time and computer power.

                    2D simulator of a wheeled robot coded in Python, using the library pygame. This project was done in a group of 3 people. We implemented an evolutionary algorithm that runs each robot in several rooms at each generation to use the average fitness as a technique to reach convergence faster. It also uses karman filters for self-localazition.

                    Trading in Forex can lead to profit if you react well (by buying and selling money) to dynamic changes in the exchange rates. However, forecasting of the Forex market is very difficult, due to its size, dispersion, and continuous operation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, the goal of this research project was to investigate whether neural networks and deep learning could be used to achieve an accurate data-driven forecast of the Forex market. This was a project done in a 6 people group.

                      Different types of auction mechanisms exist, and each of them has certain advantages and disadvantages. An “ideal” auction mechanism should maximize profits of sellers and buyers, maintain price stability, be “fair” and non-biased.

                      This program simulates a modified second-price sealed-bid (Vickrey) auction scenario, both "pure" and level commitment version. The purpose of it is studying how "ideal" this kind of auctions and some bidding techniques are. To do so, it generates as output the statistics of market price, the sellers profit and the buyers profit. This was a project done in a 4 people group.

                      Strategic voting is common in political elections and there are various famous examples for this from different countries (see in References section). Moreover, because of the increasingly common usage of electronic voting and the risk of influencing the outcome through illegally manipulating the voters’ preferences, the topic of strategic voting is receiving steadily growing attention since some years.
